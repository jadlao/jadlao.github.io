The weather forecaster app uses the geolocation method
to get the coordinates of your current location. I
experienced a bit of difficulty using it on the Chrome
browser, since geolocation was deprecated on unsecure
origins. So I
either had the choice of using another API as a fallback
method that gets
the coordinates of your location or get my portfolio
website (where it will be hosted) SSL certified so the
method works on Chrome.
 
I chose the latter method and got my site 
SSL certified through Cloudflare. This was so in
case any similar issues came up with other things
I build.
 
I used weather data from the Dark Sky API. The site
rendered data including the timezone of your location,
weather summary, temperature, and icon name. The actual
SVG icons that render are from another library called
weather-icons.css.
 
Depdending on the icon data from Dark Sky API, I matched
different weather conditions to the corresponding SVG
icon. In this case, I used switch statements, since
there was a fixed number of weather conditions the site
was going to display.
 
The temperature originally displays in Farenheit, and
you can click a button to toggle between Celsius and
Farenheit. I used 2 functions to convert the temperature
back and forth.
