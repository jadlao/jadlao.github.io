The Random quote machine is a project that is part of
FCC curriculum. I built it using the random famous
quotes API. I created the getQuote function which uses
AJAX to call the API and get a response. I set the
endpoint to get only quotes in the "famous" category
and not the others. The quote text was then appended
to the container.
 
The getQuote function executes upon page load, and also
when a button is clicked. The background colour of
the container and font-colour also changes as each
new quote is appended.
 
For that, I created a
randomColors function. A selection of different colours
was put in an array, and a random number was selected
each time a new quote was requested. The colour would
change according to whatever number item in the array
the particular colour was.
 
I also included some logic that prevents the same
colour from being selected consecutively. So each new
quote comes in a new colour.
