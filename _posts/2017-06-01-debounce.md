Throttling and debouncing are two different ways of
limiting the amount of Javascript code executed
based on DOM events which impacts a site's
performance.
 
Libraries like underscore.js or lodash.js contain
these two functions.
 
The difference between the two are as follows:
 
**Throttling** - defines the maximum number of times an
event can fire for a set time interval.
 
**Debouncing** - defines the period of time after which
an event can fire again.
 
In my Olooq project, I implemented debouncing to reduce
the number of scroll events firing in the DOM. The
result was less clunkiness when scrolling.
